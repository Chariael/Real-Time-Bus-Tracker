This is a repository for one of the projects completed during MITxPro Emeritus' Professional Certificate in Coding: Women's Cohort - August 2021 course.

Real-Time Bus Tracker README

Description:
This “Real-Time Bus Tracker” shows the actual location of bus stops between Harvard and MIT. It can be used to help you navigate between the two institutions or as an example of what sort of tools can be applied to help someone navigate between any two points. 

To use this:
   Copy the repository to your local machine, then open the .html file in a browser of your choice. An image of a map and a button should appear. Clicking the words in the button should activate the code to move the marker along the bus stops between Harvard and MIT. If this doesn’t work, please double check that Index.html is located in the same folder on your computer as Styles.css and mapanimation.js. This html file will not work unless its friends are in the same folder.

Improvements Roadmap:
    Eventually I’d like to add a button that rests the position of the bus marker or at least refreshes the page. I’d also like to add buttons for each of the times on the bus schedule, so the user can see where the bus should stop at a given time. Additionally, the code could be linked to the bus schedule or to traffic reports in such a way as to show where the real bus is at this very minute, ideally with an adorable little bus icon.
